    "# Q.6 CNN with SGD, MC Dropout, and Epistemic Uncertainty\n",
    "Train a controlled convolutional neural network (CNN) on a subset of the SVHN dataset using SGD optimizer. Then, apply Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout at inference to estimate both test accuracy and epistemic uncertainty. Set random seeds to 42. Use the following configuration:\n",
    "- Load SVHN and normalize pixel values to [0,1]\n",
    "- Use only the first 2000 training samples and first 500 test samples\n",
    "- Input shape: 32 × 32 × 3\n",
    "- CNN architecture:\n",
    "- Conv2D: 32 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation\n",
    "- MaxPooling2D: 2×2\n",
    "- Conv2D: 64 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation\n",
    "- MaxPooling2D: 2×2\n",
    "- Flatten\n",
    "- Dense: 128 neurons, ReLU activation\n",
    "- Dropout: 0.25 (keep during inference for MC Dropout)\n",
    "- Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax\n",
    "- Optimizer: SGD with momentum = 0.9, learning rate = 0.01\n",
    "- Loss: sparse categorical crossentropy\n",
    "- epochs = 15, batch size = 32\n",
    "- For MC Dropout:\n",
    "- Enable dropout during inference\n",
    "- Average predictions over 20 stochastic forward passes\n",
    "- Compute the epistemic uncertainty as the predictive variance across passes\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.1 Report the plain test accuracy of the CNN trained with SGD (no MC Dropout).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.2 Report the MC Dropout-enhanced accuracy (averaging 20 stochastic predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.3 Compute the average epistemic uncertainty (mean predictive variance) across all test samples. Report it as a deterministic number rounded to 3 decimal places\n"
